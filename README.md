# alerta-docker
Alerta Docker

Because I had some issues finding the documnentation I needed in order to configure Alerte, I have decided to include my configurations here, in case someone might it them helpful.

### telegram.json
This is the template used by the Alerta to generate Telegram messages from alerta. I find it have just enough but not too much.

### pg_hba.conf
I have also added the way I have Postgres configured.

## TrueNAS alerting
See my fork of https://github.com/tbbkitty/freenas-alerta on how you can configure alerting from TrueNAS to Alerta.
